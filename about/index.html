                <p>Hi!</p>
                <p>I am currently studying a Bachelor of ICT at the University of Tasmania, with a major in artificial intelligence. My interests are generally inclusive of anything computer science adjacent, but I'm especially interested in algorithm design and optimisation, scientific programming, and machine learning (specifically reinforcement learning). As a recipient of numerous scholarships including the Thomas Crawford University of Tasmania Scholarship and the Catalyst Program Scholarship, I strive to challenge myself and am always seeking to further my comprehension and skills in computer science and mathematics. To this end, I have undertaken two UTAS research projects throughout my undergraduate study, including the UTAS Dean's Summer Research Scholarship. I am also a former UTAS High Achiever Program participant, and have received a CSIRO-UTAS studentship for 2026.</p>

                <p>I studied a broad range of subjects in college (Y11/12), ranging from maths, physics and electronics, to English writing, graphic design, and engineering design. I was top of my cohort in Year 11, and top of my cohort for TASC Electronics (3) and TASC Engineering Design (2) in Year 12. Additionally, during Year 12, I participated in the UTAS High Achiever program, where I studied KIT101 (Programming Fundamentals) and KIT107 (Programming). I received an ADF Future Innovators' Award at the conclusion of Year 12, and a top-100 ATAR (98.55).</p>

                <p>I have also studied a broad range of electives during my undergraduate study, with a preference for the most challenging programming-oriented units (which are, admittedly, becoming a scarcity). These electives include Math 1A & 1B, a stats unit, and units from other BICT majors such as the cybersecurity and games majors (in addition to my own major). To date, I have achieved a 7.0 GPA, and usually achieve a final mark in the mid-90s in my favourite classes. My best result was achieved in KIT307 (Computer Graphics and Animation: Principles and Programming), where I achieved a perfect 100, which was a personal milestone and goal of mine. In 2026, I will be commencing a studentship with the CSIRO, where my project will be focussed on optimising a navigational algorithm for use onboard autonomous marine vehicles.</p>

                <p>Some highlights of my degree have been the two research projects that I've incorporated into my study. My first project, completed at the end of my first year, involved <a href="/projects/allProjects/ecoacoustics/">training machine learning models for bioacoustic classification</a>, completed under the Dean's Summer Research Scholarship. My second project involved the development of a <a href="/projects/allProjects/generalisedCoordinateLearning/">novel reinforcement learning algorithm</a>, including the complete implementation of training environments and the algorithm itself, as well as writing an unpublished paper on the project.</p>

                <p>Outside of my academics, I am a keen cricketer, and enjoy CAD design and 3D printing as a hobby. I started <a href="/projects/allProjects/createt/"><i>createt Designs</i></a> in 2022 as a way of sharing my designs with other hobbyists, and with the aspiration to make some money by doing so. To date, the latter goal has not ensured, but nevertheless many of my designs have achieved widespread popularity. On <a href="https://www.crealitycloud.com/user-profile/1661002868/models">Creality Cloud</a> (my most popular platform), I have over 300 followers, have received over 5,000 'likes', and my some of my most popular designs have been viewed over 10,000 times, with many designs having received hundreds of 'likes' each. For two consecutive years, I have been among the Creality Cloud top 100 designers worldwide in 2024 and 2025, and have won placings in a couple of the platform's design competitions. On <a href="https://cults3d.com/en/users/createt/3d-models">Cults3D</a>, I am listed as a 'verified designer', and many of my designs have been featured as popular designs.</p>

                <p>In terms of work experience, I have worked at BSH Electrical as a technician over the 2025/2026 summer break.</p>

                <br>
