    <p>🤖 This website was coded from scratch in vanilla HTML+CSS+JS. The use of generative AI was minimal, and was only used a couple of times to generate boilerplate code and undertake minor JS-specific debugging. This website is an ongoing personal project, and as such, I have independently completed 99% of the requisite work (with generative AI comprising the other 1%). I stand against the mainstream adoption and usage of generative AI. It is a tool for simple tasks, not a replacement for human competency.</p>
