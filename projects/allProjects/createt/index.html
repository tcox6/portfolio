                <h1>createt Designs</h1>
                <p>I started <i>createt Designs</i> in late 2022 with the aim of sharing some of my designs with the wider 3D printing community. My designs have since amassed a modest amount of success, having received over 150,000 views, well over 10,000 downloads, many thousands of 'likes', and hundreds of sales (though most of my designs are available to download for free). I've also won placings in international design contests (albeit on a lesser-known platform). On my most popular platform, <a href="https://www.crealitycloud.com/user-profile/1661002868/models">Creality Cloud</a>, I have over 350 followers, and have been among the platform's top 100 designers in both 2024 and 2025.</p>

                <p>I can be found on the following platforms:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.crealitycloud.com/user-profile/1661002868/models">Creality Cloud</a></li>

                </ul>

                <p>The following subsections provide some additional commentary on my favourite designs. (There's plenty more available at the above links.)</p>

                <h2>Christmas Tree Secret Stasher</h2>
                <p>This was one of my first successful models. The aesthetics were inspired by some several other designs, and after finishing the exterior, I had the idea to hollow-out the tree and add a lid to its base. Across all platforms, it has been downloaded thousands of times, and won a runner-up place in Creality Cloud's 2023 Christmas Design Contest.</p>

                <h2>Mechanical Easter Egg</h2>
                <p>This is one of my all-time favourite designs. I experimented with many mechanisms before I found one that worked reliably. I settled on a screw-based design, whereby turning the screw would push a travelling nut upwards, and the nut would push the egg's 'petals' outwards via six connected arms. To ease assembly, the arms and nut were designed to be 'print in place', whereby the arms were printed pre-attached to an axle on the nut assembly. The design won second place in Creality Cloud's 2024 Easter Design Contest.</p>

                <h2>Personalised Coaster Collection</h2>
                <p>After making a series of personalised coasters for my family, I was inspired to publish a collection for a broader audience. However, since it was obviously not possible to create coasters with every possible name in existence, I needed to decided how I'd select the names for my collection. Thankfully, the US Social Security Administration publishes annual data on every baby name in the US (mathematically, a bag of names). Using this data, I selected the top 200 names from each year between 1970 and 2022, which yielded approximately 1000 unique names in total. Then, using Fusion 360's scripting API, I was able to automate the process of editing these names into the existing design, and exporting each coaster to an STL file.</p>

                <p>The purpose of the coasters is to clearly identify the ownership of cups and glasses that are in-use during the day (because accidentally using someone else's glass would be yucky). Since their instatement, the coasters have significantly reduced the amount of glassware that is washed-up throughout the day.</p>

                <p>These coasters have been downloaded thousands of times, and I've fulfilled hundreds of name requests (where I've added additional coasters with requested names that weren't originally included in the collection).</p>

                <p>I later published a follow-up design with over 4000 unique names and improved aesthetics (though the latter quality is apparently subjective).</p>

                <h2>Christmas Tree Present Pooper</h2>
                <p>This is also one of my all-time favourite designs. It's a christmas tree that dispenses (poops) presents when pressed-down. The design was technically a year in the making since I started it for in late 2024, but was unable to get it working before Christmas, so shelved it for a year, and finished it in time for Christmas 2025. I tried many different mechanisms, and countless iterations of each mechanism. In the end, I settled on something akin to a click-pen mechanism. The presents are dispensed by a rotating bottom cover with a single hole (i.e., the presents initially sit on the cover, but fall through the hole when the cover is rotated). When the tree is pressed-down, it pushes the cover down, but while the tree is still moving down, the cover will reach the end of its rails, and will start to turn counter-clockwise approximately 30 degrees. When the tree is released, it will allow the cover to spring back up, completing its rotation, and thus allowing a present to fall through the hole. The design won a runner-up place in Creality Cloud's 2025 Winter Design Contest.</p>
