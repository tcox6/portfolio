				<h1>Procedural Minions Animation</h1>
				<p>This was my final assignment for KIT307 (Computer Graphics and Animation: Principles and Programming). The project brief was to create a procedural 3D animation, though the subject-matter was left to the individuals' discretion. Everything in the animation is generated procedurally, including meshes, animations, camera movements, texture mapping, and mesh skinning. Aside from the texture on the castle (which I created myself) and other solid textures, the animation does not use any imported assets; it's all code (thousands of lines of it). The animation was programmed using the Unity API.</p>

				<p>A major part of this project was programming the characters' skinning animations. Skinning refers to a mesh deformation technique where a character's mesh is organically deformed to follow an internal skeleton. In my implementation, each mesh vertex could be associated with a maximum of three bones, and for each associated bone, a 'bone weight' stipulated the extent to which the vertex should be transformed by the bone (where the sum of the bone weights for a vertex is 1.0). Once implemented, the I found that the single-threaded skinning calculations took too long to execute, so I used the Unity Jobs system to parallelise the calculations according to the SIMD paradigm.</p>

				<p>I'd love to say more about the project and dive into some of the technical components, but I fear that doing so could constitute an academic integrity violation😢.</p>

				<p>A brief note to UTAS students: KIT307 is a seriously awesome unit. Completing this unit has drastically improved my ability to manage complexity, and has noticeably made me a better programmer. In particular, the unit improved the rate at which I am able to produce code, as well as my ability to keep-track of complex code; lots of my other projects now seem trivial in comparison. Even though it's not directly relevant to my career aspirations, I believe that KIT307 is currently the most important unit in the BICT (or, at least, one thereof). If you're a technical student, you simply can't miss this unit (especially if you have a background or affinity for maths).</p>
