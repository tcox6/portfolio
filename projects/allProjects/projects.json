The main objective of the project was to investigate the efficacy of the binary relevance technique for multi-label classification, and assess the adequacy of the initial training data that had been acquired for the project. The project involved training machine learning models (CNNs) on acoustic recordings, and Python scripts were developed to process JSON label files, as well as automate the extraction of individual call segments from long WAV files."

However, I prefer to implement my environments 'from scratch', and that's what I've done here. The project features an environment editor allowing custom road networks to be constructed from straight and curved segments, as well as T-intersections and cross-intersections. The agent learns using the DDPG algorithm (an off-policy actor-critic algorithm designed for continuous action spaces). I am working on converting this into a multi-agent learning environment (MARL)."
