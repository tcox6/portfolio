The main objective of the project was to investigate the efficacy of the binary relevance technique for multi-label classification, and assess the adequacy of the initial training data that had been acquired for the project. The project involved training machine learning models (CNNs) on acoustic recordings, and Python scripts were developed to process JSON label files, as well as automate the extraction of individual call segments from long WAV files."

However, I prefer to implement my environments 'from scratch', and that's what I've done here. The project features an environment editor allowing custom road networks to be constructed from straight and curved segments, as well as T-intersections and cross-intersections. The agent learns using the DDPG algorithm (an off-policy actor-critic algorithm designed for continuous action spaces). I am working on converting this into a multi-agent learning environment (MARL)."

I designed the (theoretically) self-balancing remote-control motorbike from the ground-up, which included counter-rotating and counter-tilting flywheels, inspired by the Brennan monorail and designed to balance the bike. Ultimately, the bike could not achieve a sustained balance (likely because the flywheels' tilting system did not include a feedback mechanism). A dramatic point in the project was when the flywheels exploded."

Ordinarily, its compilation would involve manually sifting through scorecards and copying stats into a Canva design. My idea was to automate this process using a Python script to automatically pull and extract the stats from a webpage, and copy them into a PowerPoint file. The final script drastically reduced the requisite time to complete the wraps."
