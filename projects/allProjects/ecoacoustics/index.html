                <h1>Ecoacoustic classification with Machine Learning</h1>

                <p>At the end of my first year at UTAS, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to participate in the Dean's Summer Research Program. I was supervised by Dr. James Montgomery and worked on the first stages of his <a href="https://discover.utas.edu.au/James.Montgomery/grants#:~:text=Internet%20of%20Things%2Dbased%20Acoustic%20Detectors%20for%20Proactive%20Monitoring%20of%20Threatened%20Forest%20Fauna">IoT ecoacoustics monitoring project</a>. My work focussed on investigating the efficacy of the binary relevance technique for multi-label classification, and assessing the adequacy of the initial training data that been acquired for the project. The project involved training machine learning models (CNNs) on acoustic recordings, and Python scripts were developed to process and collate JSON label files, as well as automate the extraction of individual call segments from long WAV files.</p>

                <p>The project was a great introduction to research, including the literature review process, research undertaking, and findings reporting (which I completed as a formal report with elements of a scientific paper, rather than a complete paper). Additionally, the experience of training and testing real-world machine learning models was incredibly valuable, and set the foundations for my subsequent projects.</p>
