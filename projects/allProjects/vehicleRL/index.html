                <h1>Vehicular RL</h1>

                <p>This was a quick, yet involved project that I completed over the Easter mid-semester break in 2024. The goal was to build an environment editor and train agents to navigate through a customisable road network. I setup the project with the intention of making it a multi-agent learning environment (MARL), but haven't finished implementing this yet.</p>

                <p>I built the environment editor from the ground-up, which featured a drag-and-drop interface for placing road segments into a grid. I defined the road boundaries as parametric linear lines, and used these borders to facilitate collision-detection and sensor ray measurements for the agents. The borders for road segments with curves were created as polygons, comprised of many linear segments. Road segments included straight sections, 90-degree curves, four-way intersections (cross intersections), and T-intersections.</p>

                <p>I used the DDPG algorithm to train the agents to navigate the road network, using sensor-ray inputs to measure the distance from the agent to the road borders. The DDPG algorithm is an actor-critic algorithm designed for continuous action spaces. It's an off-policy algorithm, meaning that it learns from a replay buffer, and uses target networks and soft updates to improve stability. Ultimately, I found that the DDPG algorithm with sensor-ray inputs was effective at solving the single-agent environment, though would sometimes fail when navigating cross-intersections.</p>
